### Deployment

For deployment I used GitHub pages, but as you see my project is full of files and the `index.html` file is inside the `build/` folder, so in order to deploy using GitHub pages we need to put the `index.html` file in the root of the repository, in order to do this we will use a simple trick, please follow the commands bellow if you want to deploy on your on repository:

- If you have the `build/ `  folder declared inside the `.gitignore`  file please remove it form there.

- run `npm run build`  to generate the build folder.

- then make sure that git knows about your subtree, using this command:

  ```
  git add build && git commit -m "Initial build subtree commit"
  ```

- after that use subtree push to send it to gh-pages branch in GitHub:

  ```
  git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages
  ```

Now you have finish check the link of GitHub pages you will find your project deployed there. you can find the link on the repository settings page.
